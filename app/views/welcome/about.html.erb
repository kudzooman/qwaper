    <div class="about one"> 
      <p>Hi, my name is Chris Elwood and I've had, and continue to have, new ideas everyday for more stuff than I even care to elaborate on here. And just to be clear, I am pretty sure most of these ideas are bad. Well, as life goes, one day, standing at a urinal I thought, "What if everyone shared their bad ideas.", I mean, if they are by self-definition 'bad', why not tell the world? Oh right, that pesky 'fear of judgment' thing. Well maybe we should all forget about other people mocking our 'bad' ideas and start revealing them to each other with the grand goal of everyone celebrating them in a new twisted way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about two"> 
      <p>This is what 'qwaper' aims to do. Here at qwaper we want to create a place where people can dump their crap willy nilly.(freeing up space for the good stuff right?) The idea is that if you leave your qwap here maybe someone else will see it and it will inspire them to create the next Google or Star Wars, or Clapper!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="about three"> 
      <p>"Whoa, whoa, whoa", you think, "That's the other reason I don't 'share' my crap with the world dude. I don't want some shmo not named 'me' getting rich off my idea! I'm outta here! Let's go everyone, this place is whack." Ok, I understand that gut reaction, but let's take a moment and consider; If you have an idea that's 'bad' and you probably won't ever get around to doing it cause you don't think it's worth it, OR you don't have the where-with-all, time, or money to do it, then why the 'flip-hole' not tell everyone and hope that someone actually does do it so that you ultimatly get what you want? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said 'flip-hole', but if you really think about this, this could be how YOU make your mark (through someone else's efforts) on the ledger, I mean this is your opportunity to declare today that, "I think this should be a thing." and ten years from now say, "See, George Lucas Jr. did it and that was my idea! I qwaped it on qwaper TEN FREAKIN' YEARS AGO!"
      Is it starting to make sense?</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="about four"> 
      <p>Also, just to make sure this is out in the open for all of us to breath in, qwaper in no way owns any of the qwaps left on our doorstep. If, somehow a qwap you leave on qwaper becomes a huge deal by your hands we assure you that you need not fear a fancy letter from our scary lawyers demanding our peice. This is about letting crappy ideas live out in the open and free to possibly find a home or at least be buried under a ton of other qwaps.</p>

<h2>How to use the qwaper</h2>

<p>Being the crap idea it is, qwaper will most likely remind you of other applications you are familiar with already. <br> With that said here is the basic guide:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>wade or skim through the qwaps</li>
    <li>is it good a qwap or a crap qwap, rate that qwap</li>
    <li>if you come across a qwap you think is actually interesting and think the qwaper might actually be on to something, go ahead and that qwap up</li>
    <li>or if you are one of the bold elite, sign up and leave a qwap, who knows, maybe lil Billy Gates Jr. is reading
  </ul>

  <p>And that's that for now, so GO GET qwaping!</p>
