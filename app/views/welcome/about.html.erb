<h2>qwaper???</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Chris Elwood and I have had, and continue to have, new ideas everyday for more stuff than I even care to elaborate on here. And just to be clear, I am pretty sure most of these ideas are bad. Well, as life goes, one day, standing at a urinal I thought, "What if everyone shared their bad ideas.", I mean, if they are by self-definition 'bad', why not tell the world? Oh right, that pesky 'fear of judgment' thing. Well maybe we should all forget about other people mocking our 'bad' ideas and start revealing them to eachother with the grand goal of everyone celebrating them in a new twisted way.</p>

<p>This is what 'qwapper' aims to do. Here at qwaper we want to create a place where people can dump their crap (freeing up space for the good stuff right?) The idea is that if you leave your qwap here maybe someone else will see it and it will inspire them to create the next Google or Star Wars, or Clapper!</p>

<p>"Whoa, whoa, whoa", you say. "That's the other reason I don't 'share' my crap with the world dude. I don't want some shmo not named 'me' getting rich off my idea! I'm outta here! Let's go everyone, this place is whack." Ok, I undersatnd that gut reaction, but let's take a moment and consider; If you have an idea that's 'bad' and you probably won't ever get around to doing it, OR you don't have the where-with-all, time, or money to do it, then why the 'flip-hole' not tell everyone and hope that someone actually does do it dumb dumb! I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said 'flip-hole', but if you really think about this, this could be how YOU make your mark (through someone else's efforts), I mean this is your opportunity to declare today that, "I think this should be a thing." and ten years from now say, "See, George Lucas Jr. did it and that was my idea! I posted it on qwaper TEN FREAKIN' YEARS AGO!"
Is it starting to make sense?</p>
